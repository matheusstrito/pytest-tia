"""Detect reflection / dynamic-dispatch markers coverage can't trace.

Coverage records the call edges that *actually executed* during `record`.
When a file leans on reflection — ``getattr`` by a computed name,
``importlib``, ``eval``/``exec``, a ``__getattr__`` hook — the edges
coverage saw may be incomplete or unstable across recordings, so
method-level selection on that file can't be fully trusted.

We do **not** try to resolve these statically; which method a
``getattr(obj, name)`` lands on is undecidable in general. We only *flag*
the file, so `run` can degrade from method-level to safe file-level
selection there and say why. Pair it with a periodic full run — that's
the honest safety net, not a precise solution.
