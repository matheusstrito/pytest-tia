"""Turn a git diff into changed line numbers per file.

We diff against a ref (default HEAD, which includes both staged and
unstaged work) using ``--unified=0`` so each hunk header pins down the
exact line range that changed, and we read the **old side** (``-a,b``)
so the numbers live in the same coordinate system the impact map was
recorded in (the map was recorded at that ref).

Per file we separate two kinds of change:

* ``mod`` — existing old lines that were modified or deleted.
* ``ins`` — anchor lines straddling a pure insertion (no old lines).

They are handled differently downstream: a module-level *modification*
(e.g. changing a constant) is a real impact, but a module-level
*insertion* (a brand-new function or test) is not.
