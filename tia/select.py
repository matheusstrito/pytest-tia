"""Decide which tests to run, at method-level granularity.

Four rules:

1. Function hit — a test executed a function whose body changed.
   Immune to line shifts elsewhere in the file.
2. Module-level fallback — a file had a module-level *modification*
   (constant, import, class body). Run every test touching that file.
3. Data dependency — a non-``.py`` file changed; run every test that
   opened it during recording (the silent-dependency rule).
4. New test — any collected test not in the map has never been measured.
