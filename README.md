# tia — Test Impact Analysis for pytest

Run only the tests your changes actually affect. Big suites spend most
of their CI time re-running tests that couldn't possibly have broken;
`tia` builds a per-test coverage map once, then uses your `git diff` to
select the minimal set of tests to run.

This is the same idea Google/Meta run internally (Test Impact Analysis).

## How it works

1. **`tia record`** runs the full suite once with a pytest plugin that
   switches coverage.py's *dynamic context* to each test's nodeid, then
   maps every executed line to its enclosing function via the AST. The
   result is a method-level map `{test -> {file -> {qualnames}}}` saved
   to `.tia/map.json`, stamped with the git ref it was recorded at.
   Because coverage is dynamic, the whole call chain a test exercises
   (controller → service → repo → utils) is captured for free.
2. **`tia run`** diffs your tree against that ref, reading the **old
   side** of each hunk (same coordinate system as the map), then parses
   each file *as it existed at that ref* (`git show`) to resolve changed
   lines to changed functions.
3. It selects tests by three rules (see `tia/select.py`) and runs only
   those via pytest.

## Selection rules

1. **Function hit** — a test executed a function whose body changed.
   Immune to line shifts elsewhere in the file (the whole point of
   going method-level).
2. **Module-level fallback** — a file had a module-level *modification*
   (constant, import, class body). Runs every test touching that file.
   Module-level *insertions* (a new function/test) are ignored so they
   don't drag the whole file in.
3. **Data dependency** — a non-`.py` file changed (config, fixture,
   template). Runs every test that *opened* that file while recording.
   These reads are captured with a `sys.addaudithook` on the `open`
   event, so dependencies coverage can't see don't become silent
   false negatives.
4. **New test** — any collected test not in the map has never been
   measured, so it always runs.

A **dynamic-safety modifier** sits on top of rules 1–2: a file flagged
at record time as using reflection (`getattr` by computed name, `eval`,
`importlib`, `__getattr__`) is widened from method-level to file-level
when it changes — coverage can't be trusted to have captured every edge
in/out of it. `--trust-dynamic` opts out. This is mitigation, not a
solution; nothing resolves dynamic dispatch precisely (it's undecidable
in general), so still run the full suite on a cadence.

## Usage

```sh
pip install -e .

tia record [PATH]          # build the map (run from the repo root)
tia run [PATH]             # run only affected tests
tia run --since main       # diff against another ref
tia run --list             # show the selection, don't run
tia status                 # summarize the recorded map

tia serve --dir ./maps     # run the bundled map store (zero deps)
tia push --to  <dir|url>   # publish the local map (for CI)
tia pull --from <dir|url>  # fetch a published map
```

Run from the repository root (where `pyproject.toml` / `.git` live) so
nodeids and file paths stay consistent.

### CI mode

The map a base-branch job builds has to reach the PR job that consumes
it. Publish it to a shared remote keyed by the git ref it was recorded
at. The remote is either a **directory** (a cache volume / artifact dir
synced to S3) or an **`http(s)://` URL** served by the bundled store:

```sh
# one zero-dependency map store for the team / CI (stdlib only)
python -m tia.server --dir ./tia-maps --port 8000     # or: tia serve ...

# base branch job
tia record && tia push --to http://tia.internal:8000

# PR job — no local map needed; pulls by base ref, falls back to latest
tia run --remote http://tia.internal:8000 --since "$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)"
```

A ready-to-copy GitHub Actions workflow is in
[`examples/ci/github-actions.yml`](examples/ci/github-actions.yml).

`run` resolves the diff against line→function tables **baked into the
map** at record time, so it never needs `git show` on the base blob —
which is what makes it safe under shallow clones (`clone --depth=1`),
where that blob may not be fetched. The diff itself still needs the base
*commit*; in a shallow checkout, fetch just that ref first
(`git fetch --depth=1 origin <base-sha>`).

## Known limitations (honest list)

- **Insertion anchoring.** Appending a function/test right after an
  existing one anchors on that one's last line, pulling it in as one
  extra test. A bounded false positive, never a false negative.
- **Coordinate sync.** The map is stamped with the ref it was recorded
  at and `run` diffs against it automatically. Re-run `tia record`
  after you commit so the map stays fresh.
- **Read deps are call-phase only.** A file opened during fixture
  setup/teardown (not the test body) isn't attributed to the test, the
  same boundary coverage uses. Files read in a subprocess or another
  thread can also be missed.
- **Dynamic dispatch / reflection / subprocesses** aren't traced by
  coverage and can hide a real dependency. tia *detects* reflection and
  degrades to file-level there (see the dynamic-safety modifier), but a
  `getattr` target in one file pointing at a function in another is still
  beyond it. Re-record periodically and run the full suite on a cadence.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Method-level analysis** (AST) — done.
- [x] **Silent dependencies** — track non-`.py` files each test reads.
- [x] **CI mode** — remote map storage + shallow-clone-safe diffing.
- [x] **Static fallback** for dynamic dispatch / DI frameworks —
  detect-and-degrade (mitigation, not a precise solution).
- [x] **Industrialize** — zero-dep HTTP map store (`tia serve`) + GitHub
  Actions template, so adopting it is a few lines, not a project.
- [ ] **Real-repo benchmark** — skip-rate / miss-rate on OSS suites.

## Demo

`examples/calc/` is a tiny suite that proves the behavior end to end.
